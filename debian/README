The Debian Package blitzortung-tracker
----------------------------

This is a source package with the main source missing. To build a working blitzortung tracker package,
get the original linux tracker sources from http://www.blitzortung.org and copy the source file into
the package source at the following location:
  source/blitzortung-tracker.cc
  
To build the package, first install the missing dependencies via
  sudo apt-get install debhelper build-essential

The go to the source package directory blitzortung-tracker-simple_15.0 to create the package via
  dpkg-buildpackage

After the successful compilation, you will find a debian package of blitzortung-tracker in the folder which contains
the package source directory.

You can now install the package via
  sudo dpkg -i ../blitzortung-tracker-simple_15.0_i386.deb
(the filename depends on the given architecture)

After the software is installed, edit the settings file
  /etc/default/blitzortung-tracker
to contain your username/password and the desired baudrate and gps settings.

After restarting the tracker-service again, it should be started after a reboot automatically.
